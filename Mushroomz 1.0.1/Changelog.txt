	Fixed : 
- Texture mapping, should have no errors now.
- Substrate recipe had a bit of a goof on using nothing but high fertility but interchangeably with quantities of 1 or 2.

	Adjusted : 
- Dwarvish Wine Ratios : Now only needs 16 plumps to start brewing, removed need for water as it'd cause a weird bug.

	Added : 
Amadou : Take 3 Tinderhoof and put it into a barrel with nitre and you get leather
Nitre : Take saltpeter and put it in a barrel with an equal amount of water.
